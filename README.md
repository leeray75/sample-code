<h1>Sample Code</h1>

<p>These are sample code from two of my B&amp;H Photo projects I developed with AngularJS and Backbone.</p>

<ul>
	<li>AngularJS: <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/cart.jsp" target="_blank">Save For Later</a> - a component/module in the Cart page for customers to stash items for later purchases</li>
	<li>Backbone: <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/landscape-scenic/ci/32846/N/3609797119/sba" target="_blank">Shop By Application</a> - a page for giving customers more information about a category
</ul>
